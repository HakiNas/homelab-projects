# Step 1 – Virtual Machine Creation (Domain Controller)

In this step, I created a virtual machine using Hyper-V to serve as the foundation for the domain controller in my homelab environment.

### Key Tasks Completed:
- Launched the **New Virtual Machine Wizard** in Hyper-V Manager.
- Selected **Generation 2** for the VM.
- Allocated memory and configured basic networking.
- Created a virtual hard disk (VHDX).
- Attached the **Windows Server 2022 ISO** to begin OS installation.

### Included Screenshots:
- `Wizard1.png` – Installation options screen showing the selected ISO path for Windows Server 2022.
- `Wizard2.png` – Final summary screen confirming all VM creation settings prior to launch.
